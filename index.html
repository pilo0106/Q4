<div>(Just long sentence.) Let me not to the marriage of true minds Admit impediments.<span class="ex2">Love</span> is not love Which alters when it alteration finds, Or bends with the remover to remove:O, no! it is an ever-fixË‹ed mark, That looks on tempests and is never shaken; It is the star to every wand'ring bark, Whose worth's unknown, although his heighth be taken. <span class="ex2">Love's</span> not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks Within his bending sickle's compass come; <span class="ex2">Love</span> alters not with his brief hours and weeks, But bears it out even to the edge of doom: If this be error and upon me proved, I never writ, nor no man ever loved.</p>
